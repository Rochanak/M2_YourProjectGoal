Self-Closing Safety Gates
High Quality. Fully Compliant. Tested.
A fully adjustable range of self-closing safety gates for use in rooftop or industrial environments. Safety gates are ideal for protecting any openings, ladder/stair access points, roof hatches, walkways, access to industrial machinery and other restricted areas, where regular access for maintenance and inspection is required. Our gates are spring loaded so will automatically close behind the user.

Spring loaded safety gates are considered the preferred solution to chains, bars or sliding tubes when protecting these areas as they automatically close behind a person, overcoming the problem of human error. The safety gate can be “retro-fitted” to existing fixed structures where opening protection is required.

We designed and tested our self-closing gates to meet the relevant standards to help keep our customers safe.by using the atmel processing
